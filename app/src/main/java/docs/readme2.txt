Important note for TA: (The code in regards to the project has not been altered asides from this text file after the due date)
* This submission was discussed with professor Brian Fraser as part of complications with a teammate which led to a broken
  submission. As advised by the professor we are submitting the earliest stable version of the application without the           application breaking. Also discussed with the professor, these are the tasks the particular individual who has now been        removed was tasked with:
  - UI (recyclerview, bottom navigation bar, etc.)
    -As a result, the currect recycler view is not correct in the layout(s)
    -As a result, there is no bottom navigation bar to go between the map screen or the list (note: there is code written           which was to correct the stack behaviour once the bottom navigation bar was created, however, this version (as stated          above) does not include the navigation bar and therefore not the stack behaviour) --> It is not altered
